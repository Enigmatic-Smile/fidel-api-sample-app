Example client for implementing with the Fidel API & Web SDK using React, TailwindCSS, Socket.io and Axios.

The client works with one of the available servers in this repo, i.e. `express-server` . Please choose one and follow the instructions in their respective Readmes to start a server first. After you've got a server running, follow the instructions below to start the React client.

To run the client:

1. `npm install`
2. `cp example.env .env`
3. Add your Fidel Test SDK Key in the newly created `.env` file. You can find it in your [Fidel Dashboard](https://dashboard.fidel.uk/account/plan).
4. `npm start`
